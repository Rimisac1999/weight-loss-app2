Individual needs and preferences vary: men generally need more food than women, young people more than older people, and athletes more than sedentary people.
For moderately active men (that work out 3 times a week), the daily intake is:

⦁	4 - 6 palms of protein-dense foods;

⦁	4 - 6 fists of vegetables;

⦁	6 - 8 cupped hands of carbohydrate-dense foods;

⦁	6 - 8 thumbs of fat-dense foods.

For moderately active women (that work out 3 times a week) the daily intake is:

⦁	3 - 5 palms of protein-dense foods;

⦁	4 - 6 fists of vegetables;

⦁	4 - 6 cupped hands of carbohydrate-dense foods;

⦁	4 - 6 thumbs of fat-dense foods.

As an alternative, you can visually weigh the food by looking at your hand, then selecting the same size for the food you are about to eat.
Weighing food is not the only important use of your hands. You can also use your hands to charge the food energetically.

Specifically, there is a chakra in your palm. This is also used by energy therapists for healing. You can use it to energetically charge the food you are about to eat.
Breakfast

07:00 – 09:00
Breakfast is a combination between simple carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and enzymes.

After waking up, every morning, drink Lemon Water: a big glass of water, mildly heated or room temperature in which you add lemon or lime juice.
Use one of the following fruits or vegetables for the juice:
⦁	Celery
⦁	Carrot
⦁	Pomegranate
⦁	Pineapple
⦁	Cucumber
⦁	Melon
⦁	For weight loss use the following juices: Cucumber, Celery, and Pomegranate.
⦁	For weight gain, use the following juices: Carrot, Orange, Melon, and Pineapple.
After 10 minutes, you can drink a SMOOTHIE.
To prepare, all the ingredients in the recipes are put together in a blender to liquefy them.

⦁	If you require a higher amount of protein, then you can add around 3 thumbs (1 cup ~ 24-32g.) of protein powder.
Smoothie variants with cereal ingredients can be turned into porridge.
A tastier alternative to the protein powder is using protein bars.
Around 1/2 cupped hands of protein bar (~ 40-60 g.)

⦁	If you are not used to juices or smoothies in the morning, you can always return to the classic breakfast for body builders composed of 1-2 palms of meat, 1 finger of nuts and 1 handful of vegetable salad.

Snack

11:00 – 11:30
Fruit snack: pick one of the variants below, and eat around 1 cupped hand of fruit (~ 80-120 g.). Choose a single fruit from the two categories or a combination, but make sure to correctly combine fruits, according to the rules.

Acidic fruits: oranges, grapefruit, kiwi, tangerines, pineapples, clementine, pomelo, pomegranates, strawberries, lemons, limes, cranberries, passionfruit, etc.

Sub-acid fruits: apples, pears, plums, blackberries, mangoes, blueberries, apricots, nectarines, grapes, guava, cherries, papaya, longan, rambutan, raspberry, etc.

Lunch

12:00 – 14:00 / 12 PM - 2 PM
Lunch is a simple combination between carbs and proteins, cooked in the simplest way.

Snack

16:00 – 16:30 / 4:00 PM - 4:30 pm
The second snack is made out of sweet fruits. It is the ideal snack before the 17:00 / 5:00 PM training.

FRUIT SNACK: Pick one fruit, or a combination of fruits, from the list below. Measure 1-2 cupped hands of fruits.

Sweet fruits: bananas, persimmons, plantains, dates, figs, jackfruit, dragon fruit, mangosteen, cherimoya (sweet apple), raisins, mamey, etc.

If you don’t enjoy sweet fruits, I recommend a handful of raw carrots! They have a beneficial effect on regulating the hormonal system.

Dinner

18:00 – 20:00 / 6 PM - 8 PM
Dinner: Is a combination between fats and proteins.
Exception: when you eat starches from legumes in vegan recipes.

In case of allergies or intolerance, replace harmful ingredients with the ones that are good for you.

Recipes can be simplified to have only 2 or 3 ingredients. This is available both for lunch (Buddha Bowls), as for dinner (Protein Meals).
It is important to understand the main goal of this program is to develop your intuitive eating.

Listen to your body and feed it accordingly!

The operating schedule of the organs:
06:00 – 07:00
It is important to wake up slowly and stretch your arms and legs. Ideally, you should have 10 minutes of stretching and breathing exercises every morning.
 
07:00 – 09:00
After waking up, the first thing you should do is drink around 250ml – 500ml of warm water and add 1 teaspoon/tablespoon of lemon juice and electrolytes (drink with a straw to protect the tooth enamel).
Between these hours it is good to prepare and eat breakfast. If you don't have time to eat or don't like to eat breakfast, you can make a smoothie (see the smoothie recipes from the Vitruvian Nutrition program) or you can consume a spoonful of honey with raw bee pollen.
If you practice intermittent fasting then you can drink a cup of green tea or coffee.
 
09:00 – 11:00
During this time it is better to avoid eating food, but if you want to eat something, take a teaspoon of raw honey to support the activity of your pancreas and spleen.
 
11:00 – 13:00
In this interval, the heart has intense activity and can be supported with an easy snack, like a fresh juice or a fruit rich in potassium.
Before eating lunch it would be good to say a prayer or do a quick meditation. In this way, you activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which will help digestion by redirecting blood to the digestive organs, and not to the muscles.
 
13:00 – 15:00
Between these hours, the activity of the heart decreases and you should relax.
The small intestine is activated, which ensures the digestion of lunch, working at maximum capacity.
Its activity is guided by the vegetative nervous system, therefore any stress or nervousness can block normal functioning.
 
 
15:00 – 17:00
This interval is dedicated to the urinary bladder. During this time, you can serve the second snack of the day, and even a tea.
This is the ideal time to start your workout program.
 
17:00 – 19:00
This interval is dedicated to the kidneys. Now is the perfect moment to hydrate after your workout and before dinner, so the digestive system is prepared to process the food you are about to eat.
During this time, ginger tea is recommended, extremely helpful for the kidneys, as well as for the digestive fire (power of digestion).
In this interval, you can have relaxing massages for an amplified and more efficient detoxification.
 
19:00 – 21:00
After 19:00, it is recommended you limit the liquid intake.
The pericardium is considered the guardian of the heart. During this time, it is believed that the regulation of Qi occurs to prevent symptoms like nausea and vomiting.
Now is the best time for leisure activities, such as reading or learning.
 
21:00 – 23:00
In this interval, the body accumulates energy. These two hours dedicated to energy recovery are called in Traditional Chinese Medicine the Triple Burner, named after one of the meridians.
The Triple Burner, known as San Jiao in Traditional Chinese Medicine or 'three burning spaces,' refers to the entire organ system. It is believed that during this phase, the body produces the highest level of heat.
Even if you feel tired only after 23:00, melatonin secretion starts at 21:00 if the lights are off.

This is why it is recommended that 2 hours before sleep you should not expose yourself to blue light (which comes from digital screens, from your TV, laptop, and smartphones).

23:00 – 01:00
This interval is dedicated to the bladder. For this to work optimally, it is best not to eat foods that are incorrectly combined or in high quantities at dinner, at 18:00 – 20:00.

During this period of time, the body's regeneration process begins. But this is conditioned by sleep. If you do not sleep, this process is not activated.

01:00 – 03:00
After 01:00, it's the liver's turn to recover.
Even if it is damaged, the liver can regenerate. It is important to have a deep and restful sleep.

Adherents of the Chinese body clock theory emphasize the importance of minimizing the workload on the liver during its active period.
This involves consuming a light and early last meal of the day, allowing the liver to concentrate on its various cleansing functions.
 
03:00 – 05:00
The last part of the night is dedicated to the lungs and large intestine.
The lungs work between 03:00 and 05:00.
The lungs are in detoxification mode, operating at maximum capacity to eliminate harmful substances.

In the past, people would wake up early in the morning (04:00 – 05:00) to breathe in the fresh air. This is when the lungs can absorb the most oxygen.

This is a very favorable interval for meditation, affirmations, breathing exercises and for treatments, especially in cases of people with lung problems.
 
05:00 – 07:00
The 24-hour cycle ends with the large intestine, which completes digestion. It operates at full capacity between 05:00 and 07:00 as this is the optimal time to honor the elimination function of the large intestine.
